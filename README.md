# PyCitySchools Analysis
# Overview
This project uses Pandas library and Jupyter notebook to analyze district-wide standardized test results.
By aggregating student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend,
this project aims to showcase various important trends in school performance which will help the school board
and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

# Preprocessing 
The prliminary steps include reading school and student data file, storing into Pandas dataframes and combine the data into
a single dataset.
